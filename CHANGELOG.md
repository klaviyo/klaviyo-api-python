# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

NOTE: For more granular API-specific changes, please see our [API Changelog](https://developers.klaviyo.com/en/docs/changelog_)

## [3.0.0] - revision 2023-06-15
### Added
- Accounts API is now available, this will allow you to access information about the Klaviyo account associated with your API key.
  - `getAccounts`
  - `getAccount`
  
**Note:** You will need to generate a new API key with either the `Accounts` scope enabled or `Full Access` to use these endpoints.

### Changed
- The names of positional arguments have changed from `[resource_type]_id` to `id` (i.e. `campaign_id` to `id`) for some relationship endpoints. If keyword arguments were used instead of positional arguments for `[resource_type]_id` you might need to slightly refactor the code.

### Removed
- All `client` endpoints - While you could potentially get this repo to work for frontend and use only these the client endpoints, this is bad practice.
 Klaviyo has the much lighter weight `klaviyo.js` wrapper [which you can read about here.](https://developers.klaviyo.com/en/docs/introduction_to_the_klaviyo_object)
  - `createClientEvent`
  - `createClientProfile`
  - `createClientSubscription`
## [2.0.0] - 2023-04-06
### Added
- Profiles API now returns predictive analytics when calling `get_profile` and `get_profiles` by passing in `additional_fields_profile = ["predictive_analytics"]`.

### Changed
- Relationship endpoints that were previously grouped together are now split into related-resource-specific endpoints. This means that all relationship endpoints have new function names. 

### Migration Guide
- To migrate to this latest version, all calls to relationship endpoints need to be updated, as in the following example:
  - `get_campaign_relationships(campaign_id, "tags")` will become `get_campaign_relationships_tags(campaign_id)`.

## [1.3.1] - 2023-03-09
### Added
- Added `page_size` support for paging through endpoints that return profiles.
